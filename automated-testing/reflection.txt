AI-Assisted Testing vs Manual Testing

Using Selenium IDE to automate login testing showed how AI-assisted tools can drastically improve the efficiency of software testing.
With just a few clicks, I was able to record both successful and failed login attempts, then replay them without manually repeating each
step. This kind of automation is especially helpful in regression testing or when you need to test the same thing across different builds 
or browsers. Compared to manual testing, where you'd type in credentials, click submit, and verify results every single time, AI-assisted 
tools save time, reduce human error, and boost consistency.

However, AI-assisted testing isn't perfect. It still relies on proper setup, and if the webpage structure changes, the recorded steps might 
break. It also doesn't "think", it just follows the flow you recorded. Manual testing is still better for creative edge cases, exploratory 
testing, or interpreting unexpected UI behavior. So while AI tools like Selenium IDE are powerful, they're best used alongside manual testing â€” 
not as a full replacement.
